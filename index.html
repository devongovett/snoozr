  <h1>Snoozr</h1>
  <p>Sometimes you don't want to worry about setting your alarm, other times you wake up groggy wishing you had chosen to set your alarm earlier or later. What can be done to solve this? Become more responsible and aware? Of course not! This is the future, get an app to do it for you. With Snoozr, you can input your preferences for sleeping and being woken up and Snoozr will do the rest. Set alarms for Snoozr to learn and Snoozr will keep track of them. Overtime, Snoozr will learn your habits and adjust how it makes your alarms. With Snoozr, the future isn't the future, the future is now.</p>
  <p>The alarm clock app, Snoozr, that learns when you need to wake up based on the alarms you set, previous input, and behavior. It adapts to your personal sleep cycles and learns your schedule over time. This app is for anyone, but will hopefully prove most useful for college students who often have schedules that vary wildly.</p>
  <p>The app operates on Android and iOS mobile devices. The learning and decision making processes is local to the mobile device.</p>
